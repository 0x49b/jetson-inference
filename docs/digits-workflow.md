# DIGITS Workflow

New to deep neural networks (DNNs) and machine learning?  Take this [introductory primer](docs/deep-learning.md) on training and inference.

Using NVIDIA deep learning tools, it's easy to **[Get Started](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md)** training DNNs and deploying them into the field with high performance.  Discrete GPUs are typically used in a server, PC, or laptop for training with DIGITS, while Jetson and integrated GPU is used in embedded form factors.

NVIDIA [DIGITS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS) is used to interactively train network models on annotated datasets in the cloud or PC, while TensorRT and Jetson are used to deploy runtime inference in the field. TensorRT uses graph optimizations and half-precision FP16 support to more than double DNN inferencing.  Together, DIGITS and TensorRT form an effective workflow for developing and deploying deep neural networks capable of implementing advanced AI and perception.
