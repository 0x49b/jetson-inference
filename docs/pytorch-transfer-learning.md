# Transfer Learning with PyTorch

Transfer learning is a technique for re-training a DNN model on a new dataset, which takes less time than training a network from scratch.  With transfer learning, the weights of a pre-trained model are fine-tuned to classify a customized dataset.  In these examples, we'll be using the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">ResNet-18</a> network, although you can experiment with other networks too.

Although training is typically performed on a PC, server, or cloud instance with discrete GPU(s) due to the often large datasets used and the associated computational demands, by using transfer learning we're able to re-train various networks onboard Jetson to get started with training our own models.  

<a href=https://pytorch.org/>PyTorch</a> is the machine learning framework that we'll be using, and example datasets along with training scripts are provided to use below, in addition to a camera-based tool for collecting and labelling your own data captured from a live camera feed.  

## Installing PyTorch

...

## Mounting Swap

If you are using Jetson Nano, you should mount 4GB of swap space as training uses up a lot of extra memory.  Run these commands on Nano to create a swap file:

``` bash
...
```

Then edit `/etc/fstab` and append this line to the end of the file:

``` bash
...
```

Now your swap file will automatically be mounted after reboots.  To check the usage, run `swapon -s` or `sudo tegrastats`.
 
## Training Datasets

Below are step-by-step instructions to transfer learning with some example datasets, in addition to capturing your own data to create new models: 

* [Re-training with the Cat/Dog Dataset](pytorch-cat-dog.md)
* [Re-training with the PlantCLEF Dataset](pytorch-plants.md)
* [Capturing your own Custom Datasets](pytorch-capture.md)
