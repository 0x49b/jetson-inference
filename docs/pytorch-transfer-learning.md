# Transfer Learning with PyTorch

Transfer learning is a technique for re-training a DNN model on a new dataset, which takes less time than training a network from scratch.  With transfer learning, the weights of a pre-trained model are fine-tuned to classify a customized dataset.  Although training is typically performed on a PC, server, or cloud instance with access to discrete GPU(s) due to the often large datasets and associated computational demands, by using transfer learning we're able to re-train various networks onboard Jetson to get started with training our own models.  <a href=https://pytorch.org/>PyTorch</a> is the machine learning framework that we'll be using, and example datasets and training scripts are provided to use below, along with a tool for collecting your own data.
