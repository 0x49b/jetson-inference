# Inference Samples (Python)

This directory contains Python examples of using jetson-inference for image recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation, and other DNNs for computer vision.  Refer to the [tutorial steps](../README.md#hello-ai-world-inference-only) for information about running these example programs.

> **note**:  for C++ samples, see the top-level [**`examples/`**](../python/examples) directory.
