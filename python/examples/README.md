# Inference Samples (Python)

This directory contains Python examples of using jetson-inference for image recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation, and other DNNs for computer vision.  Refer to the [tutorial steps](../../README.md#hello-ai-world-inference-only) for information about running these examples.

> **note**:  for C++ samples, see the top-level [**`jetson-inference/examples/`**](../../examples) directory.
